.Question 1
Suppose I define the following function in R

ans : - The number 27 is returned

.Question 2
The following code will produce a warning in R.

ans : - 'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.

.Question 3
Consider the following function

ans : - 10

.Question 4
Consider the following expression:
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}

ans : - 10

.Question 5
Consider the following R function
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
}

ans : - f

.Question 6
What is an environment in R?

ans : - a collection of symbol/value pairs

.Question 7
The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?

ans : - lexical scoping

.Question 8
How are free variables in R functions resolved?

ans : - The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined


.Question 9
What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?

ans : - All objects must be stored in memory

.Question 10
In R, what is the parent frame?

ans : -It is the environment in which a function was defined(wrong)
